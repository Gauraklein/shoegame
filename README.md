This project was created as a practical application of rendering from Javascript Objects. Through this project I expanded my understanding of Jquery as well as the Javascript map method. I decided on an e-commerce site so that I could further understand the concept of a "cart" and using click events to add and remove items.

## Technologies Used
- Jquery
- .map()
- HTML
- CSS
